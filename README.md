# myCvPage Public
 To show whats beneath the hood of my CV web page!

 So here are all the folders, files, functionalities etc. of my CV web page.
 Even though there is a "possibleLogin" and "database" folder in the directory, the page itself doesn't have these functionalities as of now (Hence the name "POSSIBLElogin").
 At first I thought I wanted to demonstrate those capabilites right off the bat, but then I thought it would be tedious and wanted the page to be more accesible. Those functionalities are shown on the Deno.js projects anyway.

 ALTHOUGH

 I am planning on creating a "leave comments page" with react soon. I mean... it's not rocket science, but it's honest work. Okay jokes aside, but after that the CV page itself would have some database action going on. Also I think it would be fun to read peoples comments of my page and the possible horrible foolery that might go on in there.

 Ja kaikki sama suomeksi tottakai.
