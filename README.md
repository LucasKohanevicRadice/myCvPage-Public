# myCvPage Public
 To show whats beneath the hood of my CV web page!

 So here are all the folders, files, functionalities etc. of my CV web page. As of now there is no registering/logging in and saving credentials into database functionalities in the CV web page (Even though there is a "possibleLogin" and "database" folder.. hence the folder name "possible"). The bases for that are there as you can see, but I just thought it would make the page more accesible if one wouldn't have to register or log into it. I am planning on creating a "leave comments page" with react soon. I mean... it's not rocket science, but it's honest work. Okay jokes aside, but after that the CV page itself would have some database action going on. The Deno.js projects linked to the page already have that, but I think it would be a fun addition to let people leave their comments of my page, on my page.
